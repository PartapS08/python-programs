# Python Course
Practicing Python coding with building small programs.

## Why Python
Python is very simple and easy to learn. 

## Key Features
- High-Level Language:
  Python abstracts away many of the complexities of the computer's hardware, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing memory or other low-level operations
- Interpreted:
  Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, making it easier to test and debug. There's no need to compile code before running it, which can speed up the development process.
- Cross-platform:
  Python is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. Allows developers to write code that can run on different operating systems without modification.
- Extensive Standard Library:
  Python has a rich standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks, such as file handling, web scraping, database interaction, and more.
- Readability and Simplicity:
  Python emphasizes code readability with its clean and straightforward syntax. It uses indentation to define code blocks, which makes the code visually appealing and easier to understand.
- Case-Sensitive
  Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct. For example, the variable names Name, name, and NAME would be considered three different variables in Python.
- Large Community and Ecosystem
  Python has a large and active community that contributes to a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks.
- Dynamically Typed:
  The type of a variable is determined at runtime, not in advance. You donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable when you create it; you simply assign a value to it, and Python figures out the type based on the value.

## Running Python Code
Write your Python code in a text editor and save it with a .py extension, e.g., hello.py.
You can run your code with:
```
python hello.py
```
