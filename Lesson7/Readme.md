### Funtions ###

Predefined <br/>
User defined <br/>
<br/>

A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task.
Suppose you have written a message to say Hello to everyone and invite to a party. You will create a function which gonna print the common invitation message and send it and it will take list of names as an argument. Now when you gonna run the function it gonna add the name of each person in your message and send the invitation. Otherwise you yourself have to edit the message each time and send it.
So function are useful where we want to perform same action multiple time.

Components of a Python Function:
- A function is defined using the <b>def</b> keyword followed by the function name and parentheses ().
- Function Name : which is used when we need to call the function 
- Parameters (or arguments) are optional and are used to pass data to the function.
- Function body : body of function contains the code
- Return Statement: The '<b>return</b>' statement is used to return a value from the function. It is optional. and if not declared, the function returns None by default.
