# Assignment Operator is =.
# It is used to assign a value to a variable. 
# It has more forms like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=.
# These are called shorthand assignment operators.

a = 10
b = a
print("Value of b is", b)
# Output:
# Value of b is 10

############ Shorthand assignment operators ############

a = 10
a += 5
print("Value of a is", a)
# Output:
# Value of a is 15

# So, a += 5 is equivalent to a = a + 5


a = 10
a -= 5
print("Value of a is", a)
# Output:
# Value of a is 5

# So, a -= 5 is equivalent to a = a - 5


a = 10
a *= 5
print("Value of a is", a)
# Output:
# Value of a is 50

# So, a *= 5 is equivalent to a = a * 5


a = 10
a /= 5
print("Value of a is", a)
# Output:
# Value of a is 2.0

# So, a /= 5 is equivalent to a = a / 5


a = 10
a %= 5
print("Value of a is", a)
# Output:
# Value of a is 0

# So, a %= 5 is equivalent to a = a % 5


a = 10
a //= 5
print("Value of a is", a)
# Output:
# Value of a is 2

# So, a //= 5 is equivalent to a = a // 5


a = 10
a **= 5
print("Value of a is", a)
# Output:
# Value of a is 100000

# So, a **= 5 is equivalent to a = a ** 5
