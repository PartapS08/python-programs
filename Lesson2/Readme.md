Python automatically identifies the type of data for us.

# Variable #
Variable is the name given to storage location where python will store the data. Suppose we named a memory location with A = 'John'. Here 'John' is the data. Python automatically gonna detect that its a string datatype and where ever we want to access the name 'John' we will put the letter A.

```
A = 'John'
print("Hi", A, "You have a new message.")

Output:
Hi John You have a new message.
```

# Rules for Variable #
